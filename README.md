# WP Utility Belt

A WordPress theme for futzing with WordPress and PHP.

-----

**IMPORTANT!**
This theme allows you to run arbitrary PHP code, which is a major security
vulnerability. Only ever use this in a local environment which is not publicly
accessible. **Seriously.**

-----

This theme makes it easy to:

* Test out arbitrary PHP & WordPress code
* Test out PHP code at any arbitrary WordPress action/filter
* Test regular expressions in PHP
* Experiment with date and time functions
* Experiment with printf formatting
* Quickly serialize and unserialize PHP
* Quickly JSON encode or decode values
* Benchmark multiple sets of code to see which is faster
